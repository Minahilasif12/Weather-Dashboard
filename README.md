# Weather and Chatbot Forecast Application

This project is a web-based weather forecast and chatbot application. It allows users to retrieve weather forecasts for a given city using the OpenWeather API, filter and sort the forecast data, and ask general questions that are handled by a chatbot integrated with the Gemini API.

## Features
- **Weather Forecast**: 
  - Fetches 5-day weather forecast data for a specific city using the OpenWeather API.
  - Displays weather data in a paginated table.
  - Users can sort and filter weather data based on conditions such as temperature or rainfall.
  
- **Chatbot**:
  - Handles weather-related queries directly by fetching the current weather of a specified city.
  - For general questions, it integrates with the Gemini API to fetch responses.
  
- **Pagination**: 
  - Users can navigate through the forecast data using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

- **Filter and Sorting**:
  - Sort weather data in ascending or descending order based on temperature.
  - Filter weather data to show only rainy days or display the day with the highest temperature.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Front-end structure for displaying the interface.
- **CSS**: Styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Handles API interactions and DOM manipulation.
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides weather forecast data.
- **Gemini API**: Provides chatbot responses for non-weather-related queries.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main files:

1. **index.html**:
   - Contains the structure of the webpage including the search bar for city names, the weather table, chatbot input, and control buttons for pagination and filtering.

2. **styles.css**:
   - Contains the styles for the project including layout design, weather table formatting, and chatbot appearance.

3. **script.js**:
   - Manages event listeners and user interaction.
   - Handles API calls to OpenWeather and Gemini for weather and chatbot responses, respectively.
   - Manages pagination, sorting, and filtering of weather data.
  
4. **table.js**:
   - Specifically handles the logic for rendering the weather forecast table, including pagination, sorting, and filtering functionality.
